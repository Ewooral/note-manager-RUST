# Serialization ................................................
    is the process of converting complex data structures or objects into a format that can be stored or transmitted and then reconstructed later. In many languages, this involves converting objects into byte streams or JSON/XML-like text formats. Deserialization is the reverse process: taking serialized data and rebuilding it into its original structure.

    In Rust, the serde crate provides a mechanism for serializing and deserializing data. It supports several formats like JSON, YAML, and MessagePack, and it can be extended with custom formats. It's highly efficient and customizable, and it supports complex types like nested structs and enums.

* To a child:

    Imagine you have a complex` Lego structure`, but you need to put it in a box and take it to your friend's house. It won't fit in the box while it's all built up, so you take it apart and put the individual pieces in the box. That's like serialization: you're breaking down your Lego structure into pieces that are easy to transport.

    When you get to your friend's house, you take the pieces out of the box and use them to build the Lego structure again. That's like `deserialization`: you're taking the pieces and putting them back together to recreate your original structure.



# Parsing ............................................
    in programming is the process of analyzing a string of symbols, either in natural language, computer languages or data structures, conforming to the rules of a formal grammar. The purpose is to determine the structure of the input sequence and build a data structure, often a parse tree, abstract syntax tree or other hierarchical structure, giving a structural representation of the input while checking for correct syntax.

    In Rust, there are several libraries available for parsing, such as nom and pest. These libraries provide tools for defining grammars and parsers, and they can handle a wide range of parsing tasks, from simple CSV files to complex programming languages.

* To a child:

    Imagine you're reading a book. You look at the words and sentences, and you understand what they mean and how they fit together to tell a story. That's like parsing in programming: the computer looks at the code or data it's given, and it figures out what it means and how it's structured.

    For example, if the computer sees something like 2 + 2, it understands that + is an operation that needs to be done with 2 and 2, and it knows that it should add those numbers together. That's what parsing is all about: understanding the structure and meaning of the code or data.
